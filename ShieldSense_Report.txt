7. Strengths

- Fast to deploy (single static file architecture).
- Good demo readiness for presentations.
- Strong engagement features (animations, modal, chatbot, slideshow).
- Modular mapping between screenshot assets and UI sections.

8. Risks and Improvement Areas
- Typo inconsistency: Quiz_gmae key/file naming should be standardized.
- Chatbot is rules-based only (limited understanding and no backend memory).
- No explicit analytics, event tracking, or conversion measurement.
- Security content is demonstrative; no backend validation layer shown.
- Accessibility can be improved (ARIA depth, focus management, reduced-motion handling).
- Footer still includes "ShieldSense Screenshot Website" wording, which may not match preferred branding.

9. Recommended Next Steps
1) Standardize naming (quiz_game, videos_update) across files and keys.
2) Replace remaining "screenshot" branding text in footer if undesired.
3) Add analytics events for filters, modal opens, slideshow interactions, and CTA clicks.
4) Add accessibility enhancements (focus trap in modal/chat, keyboard-first flow, motion preferences).
5) Introduce backend/API integration for richer chatbot intelligence and live product data.
6) Add basic SEO metadata and Open Graph tags.
